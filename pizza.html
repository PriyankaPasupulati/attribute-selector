<p>A veggie pizza is a pizza that doesn't contain any meat toppings. Instead, it's loaded with a variety of vegetables, making it a delicious and colorful option for vegetarians and vegans. Common vegetable toppings for veggie pizza include bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, olives, spinach, artichokes, broccoli, and sometimes even things like eggplant or zucchini. These toppings can be paired with a variety of sauces and cheeses, depending on personal preference. Veggie pizzas are a great way to enjoy a tasty and nutritious meal while still satisfying those pizza cravings!</p>
