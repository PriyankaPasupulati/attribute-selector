<p>A  burger is a burger patty that does not contain meat. It's typically made from ingredients like vegetables, legumes (like lentils or beans), grains (such as quinoa or oats), tofu, mushrooms, or a combination of these. The patty is often seasoned and cooked similarly to a traditional meat patty. Veggie burgers are a popular option for vegetarians and vegans, as well as those looking to reduce their meat consumption for health or environmental reasons. They can be served on a bun with traditional burger toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion, and condiments, just like a regular burger.</p>
